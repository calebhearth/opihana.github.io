title: A little bit about me
description: Iâ€™m a design manager, based in Austin, working at HashiCorp.
---

<p>I've been a product designer and/or software engineer since
2014. I started off with a few different healthcare startups and non-profits, but
now you can find me in the dev tooling and infrastructure industry at HashiCorp.
Someday, I hope to use this blog a little more often than the once-a-year cadence
I've been keeping.</p>

<p>Outside of work and blogging, I much prefer to be outdoors: hiking, biking,
skiing, woodworking, gardening. I also love being in the kitchen, making wild
ice cream flavors or homemade pastas. I live with my small but
growing family, largely centered around our handsome pit bull, Zeke.</p>
