<p>I enjoy using this forum to write articles about designing in my industry.
There don’t seem to be a lot of designers in this niche--this intersection of
devops, networking, IT security, infrastructure software, developer tooling,
containerization, etc.</p>

<p>The blog and dribbblesque content of the design world is largely driven by
visual designs of consumer-facing apps, leaving in the shadows so much UX work
that goes into making those applications run in the first place.</p>

<p>So this blog is a tribute to those “unflashy designs”, user experiences
crafted for the folks who spend their days buried in log output or API
documentation. I hope some of this content helps designers in the
infra-sec-dev-ops space find some guidance and camaraderie, or, that it helps
engineers build more user friendly IT software.</p>

<p>Outside of work and blogging, I much prefer to be outdoors: hiking, biking,
skiing, woodworking, gardening. I also love being in the kitchen, making wild
ice cream flavors or interesting sourdough breads. I live with my small but
growing family, largely centered around our pathetically needy pit bull,
Zeke.</p>
