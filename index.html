<p>Hi,<p>

<p>I’m a product designer and developer based in Austin, Texas. I’m experienced
working on small teams to build important tools, mostly in the healthcare
technology space.<p>

<p>I do end-to-end design, which means I am comfortable and capable of leading or
participating in all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design sprints</li>
  <li>user tests</li>
  <li>wireframes</li>
  <li>mocks</li>
  <li>clickable prototypes</li>
  <li>HTML & CSS/Sass</li>
</ul>

<p>I might be available for contract work. Please <a
  href="mailto:Hannah@opihana.com">email me</a> to set up a meeting
to discuss your project.</p>

<p>Hannah</p>

<p>P.S. I make ice cream, too. Separate site coming soon. Check out my first
event Thursday, December 14 for free ice cream sandwiches at Austin Bouldering
Project at 8:30 pm. Holiday flavors!</p>
