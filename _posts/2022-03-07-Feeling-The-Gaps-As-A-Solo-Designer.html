<p>Right before joining HashiCorp, I felt lost. After spending years on a series
of small teams working as the solo designer, I had been laid off. I felt a deep
pang of failure.</p>

<p>After a few months riding the emotional rollercoaster that people call
“freelancing”, I joined HashiCorp in January 2018.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, I realized why I had previously been so mediocre at my
job.</p>

<p>Being the only designer (I was an engineer, too) on small teams allowed me to
grow quickly at the beginning of my career. I saw a huge breadth of
responsibility across the realm of tech. I did everything from interviewing
customers to designing visual mockups to writing tests for our Rails
applications. I wouldn’t trade that experience for anything.</p>

<p>But doing so only served my growth for a short time. I stayed in the “solo
designer” position for too long. My skills stagnated. And worse, I didn’t know
it.</p>

<p>A lone designer does multiple jobs at once. I was a project manager, creating
processes where there were none and corralling stakeholders who didn’t know what
a radio button was. I was a UX researcher in ambiguous spaces, a data analyst of
my own self-determined success metrics, and a visual designer with a hacked
together UI kit in place of a design system.</p>

<p>It was great.</p>

<p>For a while.</p>

<p>I could only learn so much before getting pulled in a completely different
direction. Most importantly, there were no designers around to give me the
feedback I so desperately needed.</p>

<p>At my current job, I finally got that focus and feedback. Our team started
off small with three of us, but we’ve since grown to a Design organization of
nearly ~50 incredible designers.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten feedback on my designs, my process, and my mindset through a
variety of different touch points with design peers, mentors, and managers.
Having come from an environment where I had to bootstrap my own learning, I
haven’t taken these larger team systems for granted.</p>

<p>A peer design critique where people know what good design is and can explain
why it works? A robust design system so I don’t have to create another
extensible input component for every use case? A career matrix where I can grow
my skills according to a documented set of expectations? Wild!</p>

<p>But having an appetite for a team didn’t mean it was a perfectly smooth
transition from solo designer to teammate. For example, despite being hungry for
feedback, I still had to learn a few skills around receiving it. Active
listening, thanking the giver, questioning with curiosity, avoiding
defensiveness, identifying recurring themes...and on.</p>

<p>I am so grateful for being on a team. Being surrounded by strong designers
was the key to my own evolution as a designer. My only regret is that I wish I
had realized that I needed peers sooner.</p>
