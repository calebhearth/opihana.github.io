<p>The best work environments are the ones where you can be your best self. I’ve
been at HashiCorp for four years now, twice as long as any other company in my
career. I feel lucky to say that I’ve had the opportunity to be my best self
here.</p>

<p>What does it take to be your best self at work? It may be a completely unique
set for everyone, and it might change over time as you or your company evolves.
For me, the most important factors that led me to being my best self at work
included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remote work</li>
  <li>Supportive peers</li>
  <li>The right manager</li>
  <li>Growth opportunities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Remote work</h2>

<p>I’m going to be real with you. I’m a better person remotely. Maybe that makes
me an introvert!</p>

<p>It’s not just about the sweat pants. Believe it or not, I wore jeans
throughout the entire pandemic, including my pregnancy. For me, remote work
isn’t all about the comfort, although my husband delivering fresh hot paninis to
my office is lovely.</p>

<p>Remote work helps me be my best self because I can conserve energy on
unimportant things, so that I have the energy to put 100% into the things that
mean a lot to me.</p>

<p>For example, I love that I can prepare for difficult conversations in
complete privacy, and enter and exit them in a compartmentalized Zoom link. I
can leave video off during large team calls without worrying about my facial
expressions or posture. I don’t have to rely on my brain-damaged memory (long
story) because there’s always Slack, Google Docs, Zoom transcripts, etc. for
most of my interactions.</p>

<p>Remote work helps me put my best foot forward.</p>

<p>I’ll also add that remote work also helps everyone annoy each other a little
less, and honestly, that goes a long way. A favorite coworker from my in-person
office days told me that I chew gum annoyingly (true). He was a compulsive pen
clicker (ugh).</p>

<h2>Supportive peers</h2>

<p>Having supportive peers starts by being one.</p>

<p>Some of the best career advice I ever got was: “Focus more on impressing your
peers than your manager.” I took the advice immediately, but it didn’t quite hit
home until years later.</p>

<p>If I only focussed on impressing my manager, I could easily take shortcuts,
overcommit to stretch goals, or overstate my accomplishments. On the other hand,
when I focus on impressing my peers, I see incentives to providing realistic
timeframes, finding pragmatic solutions that might not sparkle so brightly, and
reflecting on what we could’ve done better as a team.</p>

<p>Being a supportive peer and having peers who support me, helps me be my best
self at work.</p>

<p>Many folks meet with their manager only once a week, and yet they work with
their peers every day all day. Working with collaborative, diligent peers also
just makes work (which is a big part of  daily life) a more pleasant experience.
And when I’m happy, I work and collaborate better.</p>

<p>What’s more, I realized at some point that my promotions weren’t coming
directly from my hard work and my manager taking notice. Wouldn’t that be a
breeze! My promotions only came after my close peers went out of their way of
their own volition to advocate hard for me to my manager. I couldn’t be more
grateful for that, and try to pay it forward by reaching out to someone’s
manager when I see excellent work or collaboration.</p>

<h2>The right manager</h2>

<p>Odd choice of words. Why didn’t she say “A Good Manager”?</p>

<p>There are a lot of good managers out there that are not the right manager for
you. Some managers are so skilled that they can change their management style
for each report, so that they can be the right manager for everyone. But that’s
not often the case.</p>

<p>For me, the right managers are the ones that provide a high level of autonomy
with course correction if I need it or coaching when I request it. At my level,
I admire managers that can share input on how I might have the highest impact on
company objectives and who can pave a path for me to grow in my career.</p>

<h2>Growth opportunities</h2>

<p>To me, growth opportunity means clear expectations with a transparent career
matrix, and the opportunity to achieve that growth through well balanced
projects.</p>

<p>I’m a sucker for structure. So the lack of a robust career matrix at previous
employers probably contributed to feeling lost in terms of professional
development. Having a solid, transparent career matrix that covers IC and
Manager development now has given me guidance on how to be my best self at work
because it sets expectations. It also sets a bar for the next level if and when
I’m interested in more responsibility.</p>

<p>But a career matrix is only a piece of the picture. It’s possible to set
expectations and then provide an environment where those expectations are
impossible to achieve.</p>

<p>Part of that environment for me has been the ability to work on the right
balance of “comfort zone” projects and “stretch zone” projects. If I sat in the
comfort zone all the time, there would be no challenging avenues for learning.
If I was pressured into the stretch zone all the time, I’d fail often or get
burnt out before I could really absorb my new development.</p>

<h2>What’s not on my list</h2>

<p>The above list isn’t super controversial, but it might be missing a few key
things that other people care more about.</p>

<p>For example, I don’t feel it’s always necessary to work on a product that I’m
passionate about in order for me to be my best self at work. It helps, sure. And
I would never work on a product I don’t feel morally aligned with. But I feel
that as long as these four things are in place, I could swap out the product and
still be happy and thoroughly challenged. That hasn’t always been my perspective
and my opinion might change in the future, but for now, this works for me.</p>

<p>Another example is something I hear about from time to time when I interview
people for roles here. Sometimes candidates say that they want to work with
people who they could “grab a beer with.”</p>

<p>Beer schmeer. I think this is an awkward way of saying that you want to be
friends with your coworkers. I agree! But it’s not a requirement. I like working
with all sorts of people, including people I don’t have a lot in common with
outside of work. I think that diversity of lifestyles makes a workplace great.
I’d have a beer with any of my colleagues (although I’m more of a cocktail
person myself), but it’s not a deal breaker for me.</p>

your best self?</p>
