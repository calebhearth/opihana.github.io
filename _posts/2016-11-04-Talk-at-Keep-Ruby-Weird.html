    <h3 class="item-subtitle">Keep Ruby Weird 2016</h3>

    <p>I gave this inpromptu lightning talk at Keep Ruby Weird 2016. Given that
    it was off the cuff, I pulled together a few photos from my recent trip to
    Canada, where I went hiking with a PhD Bear Biologist. She told me
    incredible stories about grizzlies in Banff and Jasper National Parks, but
    one of the most interesting stories was about a research group that did a
    study on why bears continued to die on the train tracks despite numerous
    efforts to keep them off. Fences and train horns didn't help, but they
    certainly couldn't re-route the train tracks.</p>

    <p>I attempted to connect this story to some of my design experiences
    working in healthcare, where we often have some "train tracks" that we want
    users to avoid, but we can't just remove them. Given a longer time to
    prepare and present, I would elaborate more on this topic.</p>
