<h2>Honey Pistachio Ice Cream</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2 c heavy cream</li>
  <li>1 c milk</li>
  <li>1/3 c honey</li>
  <li>1/4 c sugar</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/4-1/2 cup pistachios</li>
</ul>

<p>Add all ingredients except pistachios to saucepan on medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally with the utensil least likely to annoy the saucepan owner, until just before boil. Move to a shallow bowl and place in refrigerator for 2 hours.</p>

<p>Roast pistachios in the oven at 350 F for 10 minutes or until a slightly darker in shade, but not browned, and be careful, since I am told nuts can get hot. Let them cool off in room temperature. After they’re cool, chop them a little bit. Alternatively, you could smash them lightly in a bag with a hammer if you had a bad day.</p>

<p>Once the milk and honey has chilled thoroughly, begin churning in your ice cream maker of choice. Just before it’s complete, add the roasted pistachios, and let them incorporate evenly. ASAP get that mixture into ice cream storage containers and into the freezer. Seconds count, so hopefully you already captured your IG Story. Let it freeze for at least 4 hours, unless you want soft serve.</p>
