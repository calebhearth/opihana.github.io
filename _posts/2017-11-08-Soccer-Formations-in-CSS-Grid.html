  <p>I’ve been having a ball playing around with CSS Grid. To kick
off my first blog post, here's how I implemented a few popular soccer
formations using one flexible CSS Grid.</p>

  <p>Because I’m a designer, I naturally started with a sketch on paper
  with marker, visually thinking through how I would layout out players on a
  grid.</p>

<p>I decided to go with three formations:

<ul>
  <li>4-4-2</li>
  <li>4-3-3</li>
  <li>3-4-3</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I implemented each formation on Codepen. I needed a grid with 4
columns (goalkeeper, defenders, mid-fielders, and forwards) for each
formation. But the minimum number of columns varied between the formations.
</p>

<p>For example, for 4-4-2, I would need a minimum 4 rows, because each
defender and mid-fielder would take up 4 rows, and the 2 forwards could each
take up 2 rows.</p>

<p>But, for 3-4-3 and 4-3-3, I would need a minimum of 12 rows because 12 was the
lowest common multiplier for my columns that would have 3 or 4 players in
them.</p>

  <p>So, in my first implementation, I used a unique set of
  <code>grid-template-rows</code> on
the container for the field. One had 4 rows and the others had 12
rows.</p>
  <p>Now, I wanted to be able to toggle between each formation on a
single codepen. I realized I had a choice about the grid contianer because of 
the varied number of rows. I could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the grids distinct for each formation and change the grid container
    layout in javascript, or</li>
<li>find a common grid container layout that would work for all my formations, and
  only use javascript to change the players’ locations in that grid</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose the second option. My goal was to only change how many rows each player
would span, and to NOT change the grid itself. So, I had to consider “lowest
common multiplier” challenge again. For all the formations, that number was
12.

<p>So for a soccer field on which players would move, but the field would stay the
same, I needed 4 columns and 12 rows. And this is the end result.</p>
