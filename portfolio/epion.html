  <p>I pair-designed with the folks at thoughbot to design this iPad-based
  application. Our goal was to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
  gathering clincial and personal information from patients during their
  check-in process. Paper is time-intensive and actually quite expensive when
  you add up the costs of printers, scanners, storage, and personel to make it
  happen. With Epion's digital check-in application, medical facilities--from
  single doctor practice to massive hospital groups--were able to save time
  and money by getting accurate and thorough data with our tool.</p>

  <p>Later, we added the PHQ9 Screener for our patients. This is a
  questionnaire used to determine if a patient is likely to attempt suicide or
  self-harm. We wanted this screener to use large target areas, as many of our
  patients are eldery or have problems like arthritis. This solution shows
  large text and large buttons.</p>

  <p>After launching the English version and getting feedback, I worked with
  translators and coded the internationalization of this tool for our Spanish
  users as well.<p/>

  <p>At Epion, I did whatever was needed--design, user testing, HTML/CSS and
  even Ruby for many months. I helped code out both the front and back-end.
  Over the course of a few years, I led design sprints each time we needed
  to solve a big new issue. It was a fun project and team that I am proud of to
  this day.</p>
