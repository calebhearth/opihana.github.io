    <p>I pair-designed with the folks at thoughbot to design this iPad-based
    application. Our goal was to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
    gathering clincial and personal information from patients during their
    check-in process. Paper is time-intensive and actually quite expensive when
    you add up the costs of printers, scanners, storage, and personel to make it
    happen. With Epion's digital check-in application, medical facilities--from
    single doctor practice to massive hospital groups--were able to save time
    and money by getting accurate and thorough data with our tool.</p>
    <p>Patients would walk into the doctor's office, pick up an iPad, and begin
    filling out their medical forms. The data requested would change depending
    on the facility (OBGYN or surgical, for example) or on the person (parent of
    a child patient or a Medicaid patient, for example).</p>

    <p>Later, we added the PHQ9 Screener for our patients. This is a
    questionnaire used to determine if a patient is likely to attempt suicide or
    self-harm. We wanted this screener to use large target areas, as many of our
    patients are eldery or have problems like arthritis. This solution shows
    large text and large buttons.</p>
    <p>After launching the English version and getting feedback, I worked with
    translators and coded the internationalization of this tool for our Spanish
    users as well.<p/>
    <p>At Epion, I did whatever was needed--design, user testing, HTML/CSS and
    even Ruby for many months. I helped code out both the front and back-end.
    Over the course of a few years, I led design sprints each time we needed
    to solve a big new issue. It was a fun project and team that I am proud of to
    this day.</p>

    <p>Finally, I designed an unparalled application to improve the receipt of
    insurance information. Unfortunately there is no picture of it, but I'll
    describe it! The app would text patients a
    day prior to their appointment if they needed to update their insurance
    information. The link in the text message would send them to a secure
    webpage where they could take or upload a photo of their insurance card.
    That photo would be automatically uploaded and text would be pulled from the
    image to discrete fields through a browser extension to the facility's
    electronic medical record for that patient. This application saved
    significant time and resources needed to keep patients' insurance up to date
    and check insurance elligibility in time for their appointment.</p>
