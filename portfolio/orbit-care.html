  <p>For the <a
     href="https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/caregiving-dementia/ideas/orbit-care-family-caregiving-planner"
     target="_blank">OpenIDEO Caregiver Challenge</a>, I designed an application
  for caregivers of people living with Dementia. Moved by <a
  href="https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/caregiving-dementia/research/caregiving-trajectories"
  target="_blank">this article</a> about the ever-mounting challenges caregivers
  face after a diagnosis, I focused on solving problems around care planning and
  more specificially, mulit-caregiver coordination.</p>

  <p>The problem at hand, summarized by caregiver Bob Kelly:</p>

  <p class="quote">"From our current vantage point, it is clear that a well
  thought out yet adaptable Caregiving Trajectory Plan from day one could have
  minimized the potential for misunderstandings and in particular mounting
  stress on my wife. A well planned Caregiving Trajectory Plan should be a
  roadmap for care capable of adaptation but designed to spread
  responsibilities, not stack them, as circumstances and needs change with the
  progression of this devastating disease."</p>

  <p>To start off the project, I created a basic user flow with pen and paper.
  Then, I laid out rough wireframes in Sketch:

<section>
  <p>Next, I shared those with a few designers and healthcare workers in my
  nextwork for feedback. From there, I iterated on the flow and built a few
  mocks of the main user flows, with the goal of keeping them simple for the
  OpenIDEO challenge.</p>

  <p>There are two main user flows. Here's how they work:</p>

  <p>To start off, on Sunday evening, a caregiver will get a notification to
  build this week's plan. From the notification screen, the user will be sent to the
  Orbit Care application, which prompts them to create their plan for the week, assigning
  team members (such as a sibling or a spouse) to specific to-do items
  auto-suggested based on the Caregiver Trajectories outlined in <a
     href="https://www.nap.edu/read/23606/chapter/5#74" target="_blank">research like
  this</a>.</p>

  <p> Next, they can assign tasks to themself or to another caregiver, and
  subsequently send notifications to other team members about their
  responsibilities. The goal here is to keep everyone is on the same page.</p>

  <p>Finally, they're reminded about their next Orbit Care check-in on
  Friday.</p>

<section>
  <p>All set! After the caregiver has gone about their week, they will get one
  more notification from Orbit Care, prompting them to reflect on their week.</p>

  <p>This part of the application was inspired by my favorite part of the Agile
  Development process: the Retrospective. At the end of the week, the caregiver
  gets to reflect on how their week went -- what they were able to complete, how
  they felt about it and what tools/services they might need to help them next
  week.</p>

<section>
  <p>Then, they can reflect on anything else and record it, and are
  offered the option to have additional services or products help them with any
  open care items.</p>

  <p>Finally, they are reminded about their next check-in on Sunday to plan
  ahead for the following week.</p>

  <p>I had a lot of fun designing this application for the OpenIDEO Challenge.
