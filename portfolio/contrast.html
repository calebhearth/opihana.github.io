  <p>I worked on wireframes and mocks for this private client. His goal was to
  find a better way to gather and display salary data with more critical
  information--from gender to title to years of experience. We decided to
  incentivize people to provide more information by providing them with an
  updated graph every time they added information to the tool. It's
  informative and, as an animation, entertaining.</p>
  <p>Future ideas for the tool include saving user's information over time so
  that they can track their own career progress over time and visually
  identify what changes caused their increases in salary and benefits.</p>
