<p>When I started working with the Muve team, I hopped in as the app was being designed
and built with the help of an external agency. The product had many
features of regular EMRs, but was also a task management program that would
guide a clinician through their interactions with patients. I spent some time making UX and
UI improvements to this application.
</p>

<p>For example, I dramatically decreased the navigation complexity from
about eight tabs to three, after reorganizing content and convincing
stakeholders to take a more minimalist approach to what would be the initial
feature set.</p>

<p>I added context to the timeline feature of the patient profile (the line
with dots). Originally, it was simply a line with dots, but I added labels
and hover/click states so that users could get a better sense of where the
patient was in the facility and process. This was a direct result of user
testing. </p>

<p>I also added some personality and functionality in our empty states. For
example, when a clinician's task list was empty, they would see this Take a
Deep Breath illustration. Many of our users loved this feature because it
actually made them smile to know that they were done with the current
workload.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, I used Codepen as a sandbox to test out different experience in
  interaction design, such as this loading spinner. I used an asset file from
  the marketing team, this bean shape, codified the layers in SVG, and then
  animated them! (This was fun, but it was eventually nixed because the Product
  team didn't like the Marketing team's funny bean shape after all).</p>

<p>I loved working with our MVP, but the more I spoke with our clinicians, it
became clear that it wasn't the right fit for our users. The implementation
of the initial product was too focused on task completion, and not focused
enough on the holistic process that staff go through with each patient.</p>

<p>It was time for a larger renovation of our product's user experience. It
was time for a Design Sprint.</p>

<h3 class="item-subtitle">The Design Sprint</h3>
<p>My Sprint co-leader and I wrangled our troops--essential stakeholders from the
business, analytics, product and engineering teams--together for a five-day
design thinking excercise.</p>

<p>We spent the first part of the Sprint getting everyone on the same page
about the state of the current MVP, and what problem we really wanted to
solve with our product.</p>

<p>After a few days bunkered in a room in a WeWork in Austin discussing
potential ideas with the group, I came up with prototypes for our new
solution. Then, I tested those prototypes and iterated. I worked with my
team on making User Flow charts to show intent to the development team and
ensure good communication about expected user paths. Eventually, I landed
on the designs here.</p>

<p>The right-hand column shows a list of forms or to-do
items that are either incomplete, in progress, or complete for a specific
phase of the patient's surgical process. The idea here was to focus on
provide clincians with a consistent and ordered process, but give them the
freedom and flexibility to do so in a way that makes sense with their
workflow, all while providing patient context and organization to their
documentation.
